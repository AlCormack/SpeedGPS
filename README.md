# SpeedGPS
GPS Module for Jeti that has a high navigation rate of up to 10hz (based on work by Tero @ rc-thoughts and some of my original RFID jeti work). I have Powerbox GPS's on my speed helis but the GPS module it uses only gives 1-2 samples per second. This means that there are not many samples in a speed run. The latest generation of GPS modules sample at much higher data rates and have the same doppler shift speed configuration for very accurate speed readings. This code configures a UBlox NEO-M8N module to put out a limited set of NMEA messages to get the high data rate over the very low bandwidth serial connection with an Arduino Pro mini. 

* Ver 1.0: Initial version
* Ver 1.1: Changed Altitude to be relative to start-position and added a 3 second wait after 1st fix to allow GPS to settle. Added a pre-compiled .hex file.
* Ver 1.2: Changed to 5hz as ports were overloaded at 10hz. Possibly due to 8 mhz Arduino chip being overloaded. Testing a 16mhz one soon. 
* Ver 1.3: Added "Â°" (degree) as unit for lat and long to support Speed Heli Pass Analyzer (https://www.helifreak.com/showthread.php?t=779897). Note: You will need to reload the sensors on the Jeti (In the Sensors/Logging Setup screen. Select 'Auto')
* Ver 1.4: Added a faster way to calc distance between 2 points as we are only doing this over a few hunded metres. This will allow 9-10hz of gps of Jeti telemitry if no others sensors using the bus. For the maths folks it is now using Equirectangular approximation and not the haversine formula.
* Ver 1.5 - Changed DoJetiSend in JetiExProtocol (changed filename to include2) from 150ms to 80ms wait
* Ver 1.6 - Added in support for ATMega32U chip (ie Pro Micro board)
* Ver 1.7 - Added ability to change between 5hz and 10hz. It also changed the GNSS setting for 10hz as only GPS sats are supported at this rate.  


The GPS Module I got here:

The Arduino from here:

and the best place to find how to put them together and the place I based this work off is:

To use the ATMega32U board (I like this board as it is small and has built in usb) you need to add some extra boards to the Arduino IDE (from arduino.cc). In the preferences window in the "Additional Board Manager URL's" add: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/master/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json
Then in the board select "SparkFun Pro Micro" and the processor select "ATMega32U4 (5V,16mhz)"

Make sure you have the contents of the SpeedGPSLibs.zip in your Arduino Library folder.

I have added an ExBus folder to this project. This is very much work in progress. On a heli with 3 EX sensors, I was not getting anything more than 5hz on the GPS. So I thought I would try over ExBus. Problem appears to be that ExBus seems to make the bandwidth for the other sensors worse, and I am not really seeing much improvement on the ExBus. Tom, from j-log fame, has a good explanation here: http://j-log.eu/s32/s32-en/telemetry-jeti-exbus/ I am going to keep playing but I'm not sure that ExBus is going to be the silver bullet here!

Big thanks to Tero at rc-thoughts. I strongly encourage everyone to look at his site.
